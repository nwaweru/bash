Having worked with Linux (Debian) for over 5 years, I can comfortably assume you have had to format your machine more than
3 times already.

## History

This project started when I kept going into my weekly rabbbit holes. I usually formated my machine after a month after I did
a couple of digs. I realized I could automate some of the things that I needed after a clean install of Ubuntu.
